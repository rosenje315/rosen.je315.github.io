    <p>3-2-1 fire! At a speed of 100 meters per second, neurotransmitters trigger intricate synaptic 
      pathways as my brain takes in new information to feed its inquisitive nature. Throughout my time at 
      Northeastern, I have long been fascinated in expanding these networking connections inside and outside 
      my brain to broaden my data science skill set and see my future in the aspiring words of professional data 
      scientists. Following my time at Northeastern, I hope to build my own intricate neural networks that will 
      implement deep learning and Natural Language Processing to solve crippling public health dilemmas and 
      engineer value-creating business models.

    <p> I hope to include these elements in my future website:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Links to past projects I have completed</li>
      <li>Multiple pages to highlight these projects</li>
      <li>If I were to start a freelance data consulting business - a place to collect people's emails and contact 
        info that would be sent back to me as the owner of the website </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> My Time at Northeastern University! </h2>

    <p>Throughout my name at Northeastern, I have been able to take advantage of numerous opportunities to advance my skills. 
      As a Data Science & Business student, I have strived to learn about elements in both of these fields and see how I can 
      integrate them into making strategic decisions. Presently, my main extracurricular commitments at Northeastern are doing
      student research at the Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research where I formulated a model dataset using a 100,000+ 
      Medicare claims dataset in R to perform descriptive statistics on vertically integrated hospitals. I am also the Chief of 
      Corporate Relations & a Senior Consultant for CASE (Consulting & Advisory Student Experience) & NCG (Northeastern Consulting 
      Group) where I have executed analysis & visualizations in Python for startup by evaluating trends in 2,000+ transactions to 
      optimize product selection & for $300M manufacturing company by assessing competitorsâ€™ salesforce distribution.
